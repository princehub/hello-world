                                eyeshadow</a></u>. Makeup doesnâ€™t have to look heavy if you donâ€™t want it to. You
                        can achieve a natural makeup look with just a <u><a
                                href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/beauty/makeup/face/bb-cc-creams">BB cream</a></u> and the

                        â€“ whether you love a no makeup-makeup look or a full glam look. You can showcase your
                        personality with your makeup and your nails! Pick a <u><a
                                href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/content/gel-nail-polish">gel nail polish</a></u> that
                        suits the season while complimenting your personality. Use dark nail colors through the colder
                        seasons and bright colors in the spring and summer!&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>Your Skin Care Routine</h2>
                    <p>Having a skin care routine is essential to achieving that natural glow we all strive for! With a
                        proper skin care routine, you are ensuring that your skin is looking its absolute best. Protect
                        yourself from the sun with sunscreen and moisturizers with SPF. Moisturize and hydrate from head
                        to toe â€“ whether itâ€™s with tinted lip balm, body butter, or a healing hand cream. CVS also

                    <h2>A Good Hair Day, Everyday</h2>
                    <p>Starting your day off with good looking locks will put you in a good mood for the day! Having
                        confidence in your hair is important and you can achieve that confidence with the best hair

                                styling products</a></u>, and treatments for your hair type. Your hair care routine
                        starts in the shower with shampoo and conditioner! Depending on your hair type, you should pick
                        a shampoo or conditioner that will give your hair the nourishment or moisture that it needs to
                        look great. Once youâ€™re out of the shower, your hair routine continues with texturizing spray
                        or mousse â€“ if you have straight hair, or hair oil and hair relaxer â€“ if you have dry,
                        textured hair. CVS also offers salon quality box hair dye to save you a trip to the hair salon.

                    <h2>Find Your Scent</h2>
                    <p>Everyone has their own â€œsmellâ€. Make sure yours is a good one and shop perfume for women
                        &amp; cologne for men at CVS. Browse top fragrance and perfume brands at prices you wonâ€™t

                        noticeable colognes thatâ€™ll make people stop you and ask what youâ€™re wearing. Shop for your

                    <h2>Care for Your Body</h2>
                    <p>Your body care routine starts in the shower or bath. Start out with a body wash or shower gel.
                        Picking your bath soap relies entirely on your preferences and skin type.&nbsp; You may want an
                        antibacterial body wash to help kill bacteria or maybe an exfoliating body wash to help wipe
                        away dead, flaky skin. If you enjoy taking time to run a relaxing bath, take the time to browse
                        our large selection of <u><a
                                href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/beauty/bath-body/bath-salts-soaks">bath salts and
                                soaks</a></u>. Adding Epsom salt to your bath will help to relieve any muscle tension
                        and help relax your muscles. This is especially helpful when your muscles are feeling sore. Once
                        you get out of the bath or shower, be sure to moisturize your skin! Being in the water for a
                        long period of time tends to dry out your skin. Bring back the moisture by hydrating your body
                        with a body oil, shea butter, or an unscented lotion. On the go? Bring hand sanitizing wipes or
                        spray with you. Restock on all of your favorite bath and body care at great prices and shop now!

                    <p>Beauty accessories will bring your skin care and makeup routine to the next level. Products like
                        makeup bags and train cases will help you stay organized and allow you to travel with your
                        favorite makeup products. In the shower, use bath accessories like <u><a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/beauty/beauty-tools-accessories/bath-accessories/q/Loofahs_%26_Sponges/pt

                                gloves</a></u> to work your shower gel and body soap into your skin. Quickly do your
                        hair after your shower with the help of brushes and hair appliances. Use a wet brush or wide
                        tooth comb to easily detangle your hair without causing breakage. Then, dry your hair with an
                        ionic blow dryer to reveal silky, dry hair. No matter how you like to style your hair, we have
                        hair straighteners, curling wands, hair rollers, and more that you would love. To enhance your
